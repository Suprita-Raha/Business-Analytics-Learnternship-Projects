During my engagement with KultureHire, I actively contributed to a Business Analyst live project as part of a compulsory assessment initiative. 
My primary responsibility involved gathering firsthand insights from working professionals, meticulously collecting and analyzing data to extract meaningful information. 
This effort culminated in the creation of a comprehensive documentation titled "Understanding Managers in India: Tale of an Employee."

Further advancing the project, I translated the insights gained into a well-defined problem statement, encapsulating the challenges faced by Indian managers. 
This transformative step resulted in the creation of a detailed report, "Problem Statement: Indian Manager Problems," 
highlighting critical issues prevalent in the managerial landscape.

To enhance accessibility and facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the data, 
I leveraged my skills to develop an insightful Power BI dashboard. 
This dynamic visualization tool brought to life the analysis of responses,
providing stakeholders with a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of the managerial challenges identified.

In addition to this strategic project, I also undertook the development of an Excel dashboard focused on order management. 
This task involved creating a user-friendly interface to streamline and optimize the process of tracking and managing orders efficiently.

Through my involvement in these assignments, I not only demonstrated a keen analytical ability but also 
showcased proficiency in translating complex data into actionable insights and user-friendly visualizations. 
This experience at KultureHire has significantly contributed to my skill set, allowing me to navigate real-world projects with a practical and strategic approach.
